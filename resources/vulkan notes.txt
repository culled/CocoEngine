Vulkan will automatically convert images to linear colorspace in shaders. Any format that includes "SRGB" will be converted to linear color space during rendering and will be converted back to sRGB after it finishes rendering. For backbuffers, the extra colorspace part of the surface format means that the display engine will interpret the backbuffer that way, not convert it. So a backbuffer with a "UNORM" format will not be automatically converted to sRGB colorspace when being presented, even if the surface format color space is "SRGB".
